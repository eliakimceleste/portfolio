## About Me

I am a machine learning specialist, passionate about exploring and innovating in the field of artificial intelligence. Much more than a simple developer, I am dedicated to a constant quest for new techniques to push the limits of the existing and solve complex challenges.

My mastery of classic machine learning algorithms allows me to tackle a wide range of problems, but it is neural networks that really capture my interest, particularly for computer vision applications. This field, which I particularly like, is at the heart of my professional ambition: to reach a level of excellence where each solution developed combines performance, creativity and impact.

Always looking for new opportunities to learn and contribute, I am ready to take on the challenges that will shape the future of AI.
